#### Limiation of BizSaprk datacenter region issue
Regarding to BizSpark enroll duration, deployment on some region limited - reported from facebook group Jung Hoon Baek.
- Could not select Japan area but Southeast Asia.

It's limitation of BizSaprk program.

By default, CloudBread is using Japan, East Asia. You might need to change ARM script region and execute it on your machine.
